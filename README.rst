Your Amazon AnalyticS (YAAS)
========

``YAAS`` is an independent consulting project with a private company on amazon -- a project I have worked on during the Insight Data Science program over a period of a few weeks.

While the codebase is public, the data associated with project is private and cannot be released. ``YAAS`` employs an ''online-learning'' algorithm to dynamically price products to maximize profit for an amazon seller.
